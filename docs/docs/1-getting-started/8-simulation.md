## Connecting to PC

Once your team number has been configured QuestNav will attempt to connect to a Network Tables server at 10.TE.AM.2. 
QuestNav can also be configured to use a specific IP address:
1. Open a browser to `http://<Quest IP Address>:5801`
2. Select the `General` tab
3. Enter the IP Address of the network table server in `Debug IP Override`

:::warning
This setting should NEVER be used during a competition. To reset, follow steps 1-2 above, then clear the contents of `Debug IP Override`.
:::

:::info
During simulation, the Quest needs network access to reach your development machine. If you disabled Wi-Fi during device setup (as recommended for competition), you will need to **temporarily re-enable Wi-Fi** on the headset so it can connect to the same network as your PC. Alternatively, connect both the Quest and your PC via Ethernet to the same switch or router. Remember to disable Wi-Fi again before competition.

## WPILib Desktop Simulation

QuestNav works with WPILib's desktop simulation mode (`simulateJava` / `simulateNative`). This allows you to test
QuestNav integration without a roboRIO by running your robot code on your development machine.

### Setup

1. **Start the simulation**: run `.\gradlew simulateJava` from your robot project directory in a terminal
2. **Configure the Quest**: set the `Debug IP Override` on the Quest's web interface (`http://<Quest IP>:5801`) to
   your development machine's IP address on the same network as the Quest
3. **Verify connection**: check that `QuestNav/Connected` shows `true` in the WPILib simulation GUI's
   NetworkTables viewer or in AdvantageScope

:::tip
The Quest and your development machine must be on the same network. To find your PC's IP address:
- **Windows:** Run `ipconfig` in a Command Prompt and look for the `IPv4 Address` under your active network adapter.
- **macOS:** Run `ipconfig getifaddr en0` in Terminal.
- **Linux:** Run `ip addr` or `hostname -I` in a terminal.
:::

### Windows Firewall

Windows Firewall may block incoming connections to the Java process running the simulation. When you first run
`simulateJava`, Windows will typically show a firewall prompt asking to allow `java.exe` through. **Click "Allow access"**.

If you dismissed the prompt or the Quest still can't connect:

1. Open **Windows Security > Firewall & network protection > Allow an app through firewall**
2. Click **Change settings**, then **Allow another app...**
3. Browse to the WPILib JDK's `java.exe` (typically `C:\Users\Public\wpilib\<year>\jdk\bin\java.exe`)
4. Ensure both **Private** and **Public** checkboxes are selected
5. Restart the simulation

:::tip
If you have multiple JDK installations, make sure the one used by the simulation is allowed.
You can check which `java.exe` is in use via Task Manager while the simulation is running.

### Port Conflicts

The NetworkTables server binds to ports **1735** (NT3) and **5810** (NT4). If a previous simulation instance
didn't shut down cleanly, these ports may still be in use. Open Task Manager, look for stale `java.exe`
processes, and end them before restarting the simulation.

## [Python QuestNav Viewer](https://github.com/juchong/python-questnav-viewer)

A python desktop application for receiving and visualizing Quest headset tracking data.
This project also acts as sample code for interfacing with QuestNav using python.
